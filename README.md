## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.11
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
- Virtualenv (recommended for isolating dependencies)

### Steps to Install and Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/katayoun_katebi/oral_disease.git
   cd oral_disease
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app/Desktop.py
   ```

### Additional Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **Kivy**: For building the UI.
- **Pillow**: For image handling and processing.
- **PyTorch**: For deep learning model development and predictions.
- **MONAI**: For advanced AI workflows in medical image processing and deep learning.

To install these dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install kivy pillow torch monai
```

### Installing PyInstaller

If you want to build a standalone executable, install `pyinstaller`:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

## Usage

1. **Run the App**:
   After installing, you can run the application with:
   ```bash
   python app/Desktop.py
   ```

2. **Upload Images**:
   Use the upload button in the app to select oral disease images for analysis.

3. **Get Predictions**:
   After uploading an image, the app processes it using the trained CNN and MONAI models and provides predictions on the type of disease.

## Building Executables

To build a standalone executable for distribution:

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   Make sure `pyinstaller` is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Create the Executable**:
   Run the following command to package the application:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed app/Desktop.py
   ```

   This will generate a standalone executable in the `dist` folder that can be distributed to users without requiring Python or additional dependencies.

3. **Distribute the Executable**:
   Share the executable generated in the `dist` folder. Users can run the application without needing to install Python or other dependencies.

## Deep Learning & AI in Dental Healthcare

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, and dental care is no exception. With advances in **deep learning** and **medical imaging technologies** like **MONAI**, AI systems can now assist dentists in diagnosing complex oral diseases with high accuracy.

### Why Use AI in Dental Healthcare?
- **Early Detection**: AI can assist in detecting diseases at an early stage, which is crucial for successful treatment outcomes.
- **Accuracy**: Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can analyze intricate patterns in oral disease images, surpassing human capabilities in many cases.
- **Efficiency**: AI tools provide instant analysis, saving valuable time for dental professionals.
  
### MONAI in Medical Imaging
MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) is a specialized open-source framework for deep learning in healthcare. It integrates with PyTorch and provides optimized tools for training AI models on medical images, such as X-rays and dental scans. This project uses MONAI to improve the accuracy and robustness of oral disease predictions.
